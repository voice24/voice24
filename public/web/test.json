The country, which is also hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, has been under scrutiny from rights groups for continued discrimination against women and the LGBTQ+ community.",

      "subtitle": "Dubai has poured billions of dollars into its pristine fairgrounds and jubilant festivities ",
      "body": "It poured billions of dollars into its pristine fairgrounds and jubilant festivities that opened last month, aiming for 25 million visits to the pandemic-delayed Expo 2020.\n\nPropping up the world's fair is the United Arab Emirates’ contentious labor system that long has drawn accusations of mistreating workers. Highly sensitive to its image and aware that Expo attracts more attention to its labor practices, Dubai has held companies on the project to higher-than-normal standards of worker treatment. Contractors offer benefits and better wages to Expo workers, compared with elsewhere in the country, and many are grateful for the jobs.\n\nYet according to human rights groups and interviews with over two dozen workers, violations have persisted, underpinned by the UAE's labor sponsorship system. It relies on complicated chains of foreign subcontracts, ties workers’ residency to their jobs and gives outsized power to employers.\nAmong the complaints are workers having to pay exorbitant and illegal fees to local recruiters in order to work at the world's fair; employers confiscating their passports; broken promises on wages; crowded and unsanitary living conditions in dormitories; substandard or unaffordable food; and up to 70-hour workweeks in sometimes brutal heat.\n\n“You can have the best standards in the world, but if you have this inherent power imbalance, workers are in a situation where they’re at risk of exploitation all the time,” said Mustafa Qadri, executive director of Equidem Research, a labor rights consultancy that recently reported on the mistreatment of Expo workers during the pandemic.\n\nWhen questioned by The Associated Press, Expo organizers did not comment but referred to their previous statement in response to Equidem’s report, saying Expo takes worker welfare “extremely seriously” and requires all contractors to comply with standards “formulated from international best practice.”\n\nExpo's statement acknowledged the workers' “most regularly raised topics of concern” involved “wage payments and food,” without elaborating. It said authorities have “worked directly with contractors to remedy both immediately.”",

      "subtitle": "Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed has been ordered to pay £554 million to ex-wife Princess Haya",
      "body": "The order was given by Judge Philip Moor in a long-drawn custody battle between the Sheikh and Princess Haya, who is the half-sister of Jordan’s King Abdullah. The Sheikh and the Princess had tied the knot back in 2004, but Princess Haya, fearing for her safety, fled to the UK in 2019 after filing for divorce and having an affair with her bodyguard.\n\nThe custody battle for their two children began around the same time, and the series of hearings that have taken place in the UK thus far have reportedly cost over £70 million in legal fees. The massive financial settlement is the latest development in this dispute and has been awarded to Princess Haya as the judges found the Sheikh to be a threat to the Princess on the balance of probabilities. \nIn particular, the Sheikh stands accused of having orchestrated the abductions of their two children—Princess Latifa and Princess Shamsa—and subjecting Princess Haya to a campaign of “intimidation.” Furthermore, the Sheikh also stands accused of using the Pegasus spyware to hack Princess Haya’s phone, and his attempt to purchase a £30 million estate next to Princess Haya’s Berkshire residence has been seen by judges to be a “very significant threat to her security.”\n\nAs per the court order, the Sheikh has been asked to pay over £250 million up front within three months for the upkeep of Princess Haya’s properties in the UK, and provide a bank guarantee of £290 million for annual payments. The total figure of over half a billion pounds is believed to be the highest-ever public award ordered by a UK court.\n\nHowever, it is understood that the Princess did not demand any divorce settlement, despite being potentially entitled to billions, and that the bulk of the payments by the Sheikh will be diverted towards ensuring the security of the Princess and her children.",

She had not received a bond Saturday afternoon.\n\nAlso Read: Dubai ruler ordered to pay a record £554 million to ex-wife Princess Haya\n\nAlex Jones, an Austin resident and founder of the right-wing media group Infowars, declined Saturday to say whether he'd been injured or elaborate on what happened beyond that he believes it was related to his wife's recent change of medication.\n\n\"It's a private family matter that happened on Christmas Eve,\" Jones told The Associated Press in a brief interview. \"I love my wife and care about her and it appears to be some kind of medication imbalance.\"\nThe Travis County Sheriff's Office did not immediately respond to a request Christmas Day for the report on Wulff Jones' arrest and a spokeswoman said she could not provide more information. An attorney for Wulff Jones did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nJones sued this week seeking to block subpoenas he'd been issued by the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Jones spoke at a rally in support of then-President Donald Trump that proceeded the riot and his Infowars colleague, Owen Shroyer, was charged with crimes related to it in August. Shroyer has said he's \"innocent of the charges.\"\n\nJones said his wife's arrest \"doesn't concern my politics\" and that \"it wasn't some kind of personal hateful thing or anything.\"",
